    <h1>5 Tips to solve a Rubik's Cube faster</h1>
  <div class="container"><p>
    These Rubik's Cube tips will help you to significantly improve your solving time of the Rubik's cube, they are generally designated for beginners who use the beginners solving method, but they will help also to more experienced solvers.
  </p> 
  <div>A. Practice, Practice and.. Practice. Practicing is the only way to improve your solving time. There is no way around it. Cutting your solving time requires practicing. However, the following tips will make the practicing much more effective. Without them, practicing may won't get you that far. Keep in mind that most of these tips will
    show their success only after a bit of practicing.</div>
  <div>B. Get a quality Rubik's Cube. The solving time depends on two things: you, and the cube. Let's focus on the other one: A Hard turning cube that stuck all the time will dramatically increase your solving time. Moreover, a quality cube will make the practice much more effective and fun, and will allow implementing tricks like fingertricks much more easily and effectively.</div>
  <div>C. Know the algorithms by heart. Practice until you'll be able to execute the algorithms without thinking about their notation. In order to do this, execute an algorithm couple of times, after some time you'll be able to execute it just with your "hands memory" and without having to think about its notation. Your solving time will dramatically reduce.</div>
  <div>D. Look ahead. The solving time splits into two parts: the execution time of an algorithm, and the time it takes until you start executing it (looking for the next piece, realizing what algorithm to use and from what angle). Algs execution time is basically a matter of practice and good technique, Just keep practicing to work on that. The "thinking" part is a different story, many are not aware to, and can take up to half of your total solving time. In order to reduce the 'thinking' time you should: while executing the current algorithm- Instead of watching the pieces being solved, already start to look for the next piece to solve. </div>
  <div>E. Use fingertricks. This tip is aiming at shortening your execution time. That will be accomplished by using fingertricks. Fingertricks means performing a single move (rotation) with a single finger instead of the whole hand.</div>
